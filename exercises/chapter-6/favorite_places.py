# 6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three
# names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places
# for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends
# to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print
# each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.
