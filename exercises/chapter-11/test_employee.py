# 11-3. Employee: Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should
# take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these
# as attributes. Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5000 to the
# annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.
# Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_
# default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so
# you donâ€™t have to create a new employee instance in each test method. Run
# your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
