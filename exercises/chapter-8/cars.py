# 8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary.
# The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
# should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
# with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
# color or an optional feature. Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure 
# all the information was stored correctly.
